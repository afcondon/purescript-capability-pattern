Working *minimal* illustration of the Capability Design Pattern

(Somewhat) fully fleshed-out example of the design pattern illustrated in Jordan Martinez' phenomenal [collection](https://jordanmartinez.github.io/purescript-jordans-reference-site/content/21-Hello-World/05-Application-Structure/src/02-MTL/32-The-ReaderT-Capability-Design-Pattern.html)
 of reference material and examples 
 
 I've added some `Aff` to the mix and made sure it compiles and does _something_ tho it's quite possible that i've made mistakes somewhere that make it imperfect as a starter template: PR's welcome.
